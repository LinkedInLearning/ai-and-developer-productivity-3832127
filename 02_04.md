1. "ChatGPT, you will act as a senior software engineer with JavaScript knowledge. I want to look up a name from 1 million student records in the database. I know the theory behind data structures and algorithms. Can you guide me through the steps for a JavaScript function to return the name with the best time and space complexity? My expectation is for the algorithm to be fast and efficient during the query."

2. "ChatGPT, you will act as a senior software engineer with JavaScript knowledge. I need a feature that allows me to filter my search results based on certain criteria. I'm familiar with the concept of data structures, but I need a step-by-step guide on how to implement this in my codebase. My expectation is a functional and fast search result."
